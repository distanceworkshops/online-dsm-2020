# Spatially explicit models for distance sampling data: density surface modelling in practice

## 8-12 June 2020, 1700-1900 BST // 1200-1400 EDT // 0900-1100 PDT

This online course will cover how to fit spatial models to distance sampling data ("density surface modelling") in R. This will include:

- Brief overview of distance sampling
- Generalized additive models
- Fitting, checking and selecting density surface models
- Predicting abundance
- Making maps

Examples will be based around a line transect survey of sperm whales in the western Atlantic.

### Format

The course will consist of 5 live sessions delivered over videoconference. Between these sessions there will be practical R exercises to complete and to assist with these practicals there will be text-based "office hours", where participants questions can be addressed. Each videoconference session will include time for lecturing and discussion of practical exercises.

We are limiting enrolment to 10 for this first offering, but may run an additional course later in the year (please e-mail to register your interest, especially if this time of day doesn't suit you or if you would be interested in a point transect-focussed course).

### Prerequisites

You should already know about distance sampling, for example by having taken an introductory workshop in person or online (either interactively or via our free pre-recorded lectures). You should also have some basic R knowledge.

Prior to the course we will running a software test meeting to ensure everyone can participate satisfactorily.

**Cost: Â£250**

**Registration deadline: 4 May 2020**
